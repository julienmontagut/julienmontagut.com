I'm a full stack developer, with a strong focus on the backend. I've been
working with C# and .NET for more than 10 years.

Recently I've been learning Rust and I'm planning to focus on it in the future.

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Agility

I'm an advocate for Agile principles. Using Agile practices and the SCRUM
framework, I've helped teams to improve their processes and deliver better
software.

For me being Agile goes through puting in place the right processes and tools
to help teams to deliver better software. As such, some practices are very
important to me, such as:

- Continuous delivery
- Continuous integration
- Pair programming
- Test driven development
